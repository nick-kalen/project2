Data Ingestion & Analysis

project.py is the script to call the remote api exactly every minute, writing the data to a sql database stored in Amazon RDS.

Data Screenshot is a screenshot of the data table called apidata after the script was run. The screenshot is large, so you might have to scroll to the right to see the "time" column.

Project 2 Analysis is the Data Science part of this project, where I figured out which variables are related and how "pi" is calculated from "factor" by using alternating series.
